Here’s a list of the top ten breathtaking hiking trails around the globe that every avid hiker should add to their bucket list.

## 1. **Torres del Paine "W" Circuit, Chile**

Situated in Patagonia, the Torres del Paine "W" Circuit offers hikers a dramatic and picturesque experience. The circuit is named for its "W" shape and covers around 100 kilometers of diverse landscape. Expect to encounter towering granite peaks, glacial lakes, and vibrant wildlife. The highlight is the monumental granite towers standing over 2,800 meters.

## 2. **Milford Track, New Zealand**

Renowned as the "finest walk in the world," the Milford Track in Fiordland National Park stretches 54 kilometers through stunning mountain scenery, dense rainforests, and pristine rivers. The hike typically takes four days and culminates at the formidable Sutherland Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in the world at 580 meters.

## 3. **Inca Trail, Peru**

The Inca Trail is nothing short of iconic. This 43-kilometer trail leads you through a variety of ecosystems, from cloud forests to alpine tundra, and past well-preserved Inca ruins. The journey culminates at the awe-inspiring Machu Picchu, offering a glimpse into ancient Peruvian history and culture.

## 4. **Appalachian Trail, United States**

Stretching roughly 3,500 kilometers through 14 states, the Appalachian Trail is a true test of endurance. Though hiking the entire trail is a formidable challenge, many hikers opt for shorter sections. The trail features rolling hills, dense forests, and picturesque vistas, with highlights such as the White Mountains and Shenandoah National Park.

## 5. **Kilimanjaro, Tanzania**

Scaling Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro, is a dream for adventure enthusiasts. The trek to Uhuru Peak (5,895 meters) passes through five distinct climate zones, from tropical forests to arctic conditions. The Marangu Route, also known as the "Coca-Cola" route, is popular for its scenic beauty and relative ease.

## 6. **GR20, Corsica, France**

Known as one of Europe's most challenging hikes, the GR20 spans 180 kilometers across the rugged terrain of Corsica. The trail is divided into two sections: the northern part, which is more technical and demanding, and the southern part, which is slightly easier but equally stunning. Expect to see rocky landscapes, glacial lakes, and dramatic ridges.

## 7. **Haiku Stairs, Hawaii, USA**

Also known as the "Stairway to Heaven," the Haiku Stairs on the island of Oahu offer an exhilarating climb up 3,922 metal steps. Though officially closed and considered illegal to hike, many adventurers seek out the stairs for the breathtaking views of the Koolau mountain range and the Pacific Ocean.
